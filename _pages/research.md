### Job Market Paper

- Climate variability and urbanization. &nbsp; 

Abstract: Some researchers and policymakers posit that climate change should increase urbanization as increasing temperatures make rural livelihoods precarious, while others posit that climate change might trap households who cannot afford to migrate in increasing rural poverty. Previous empirical evidence on the link between climate and urbanization is inconclusive. This paper uses new data derived from satellite imagery that maps urbanization for 7,550 cities in low and lower-middle income countries across 23 years to provide new evidence on the relationship between drought and urbanization. Cities experience large and persistent declines in growth rates after major drought events: after 11 years, city growth rates are 1 percentage point lower, compared to an average growth rate of 2.5% per year. I show that the contemporaneous effect of drought on urban growth is misleading and fails to account for the full dynamic effects of drought. Consistent with models that envision a drought-migration poverty trap, the negative effects on urbanization are largest in the poorest tercile of countries.

Abstract:

- Mapping Historical Climate Migration With 1.6 Million Aerial Photographs (joint with Hannah Druckenmiller, Solomon Hsiang, Trinetta Chong, Shruti Jain, Andreas Madestam, Luna Yue Huang, Simon Greenhill, Joel Ferguson, Hikari Murayama, Sherrie Wang and Anna Tompsett). &nbsp; 

Abstract:

Satellite imagery has transformed our understanding of both the natural world and human well-being, but the instrumental record only begins in 1972. We develop an approach to extend these data backwards in time an additional 30 years. We digitize the archive of 1.6 million aerial photographs collected during the processes of mapping what was then British colonies. This archive surveys more than 60 former colonies, where granular data from other sources is notoriously sparse, from the 1940s to the 1990s. We develop a machine learning approach to assemble these photographs into mosaics comparable to modern satellite observations. We then generate large-scale, gridded datasets that provide measures of population density, land use, and infrastructure.
